# README.md file for instagram lab

I used @media queries to make responsive CSS to change the instagram webpage depending on screen size.

```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 800px)
```
I used the size of the whole layout to determine the max width for the site to change.

In the smaller screen i used this code to remove the picture of the phones to create more space for the form.

```CSS
    .iphones {
      display: none;
      }
```

and using

```CSS
    font-size: 2vw;
```

I made the font size get smaller as the page width decreases.
